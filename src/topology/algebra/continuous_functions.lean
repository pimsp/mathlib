# Algebraic structures over continuous functions

In this file we define instances of algebraic sturctures over continuous functions. Instances are
present both in the case of the subtype of continuous functions and the type of continuous bundled
functions. Both implementations have advantages and disadvantages, but many experienced people in
Zulip have expressed a preference towards continuous bundled maps, so when there is no particular
reason to use the subtype, continuous bundled functions should be used for the sake of uniformity.

### Algebra structure

In this section we show that continuous functions valued in a topological algebra `A` over a ring
`R` inherit the structure of an algebra. Note that the hypothesis that `A` is a topological algebra is
obtained by requiring that `A` be both a `topological_semimodule` and a `topological_semiring`
(by now we require `topological_ring`: see TODO below).-/

/- TODO: We are assuming `A` to be a ring and not a semiring just because there is not yet an
instance of semiring. In turn, we do not want to define yet an instance of semiring because there is
no `is_subsemiring` but only `subsemiring`, and it will make sense to change this when the whole
file will have no more `is_subobject`s but only `subobject`s. It does not make sense to change
it yet in this direction as `subring` does not exist yet, so everything is being blocked by
`subring`: afterwards everything will need to be updated to the new conventions of Mathlib.
Then the instance of `topological_ring` can also be removed, as it is below for `continuous_map`. -/
